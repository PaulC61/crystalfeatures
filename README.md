# CrystalFeatures

CrystalFeatures is a set of python codes that extract features of crystal systems, using only the CIF file as input, for machine learning applications. There are three classes of features in CrystalFeatures: basic atomic and crystal descriptors (BACD), which include statistical properties of the atoms in the materials as well as the crystal symmetry; geometry features, which are based on bonding properties; and robust one-shot ab initio (ROSA) descriptors, where the eigen values of the material are obtained using a single-point single step calculation is performed using GPAW.

# Data for ROSA paper 

## Link to paper: https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-022-00658-9

In order to reproduce the results in the manuscript, the trained XGBOOST models are provided in the folder `/data/models/`, and the test set data are provided in the folder `/data/test/` for each of the properties listed in the paper.

## Please note

To generate ROSA descriptors using GPAW, you need to modify the `scf.py` code of your GPAW according to the one in this repository. If you are using GPAW version 21.1.0, you can simply overwrite your `scf.py` with the one provided here. Otherwise, just comment a few lines of code in your `scf.py` as shown in the `scf.py` provided here. To find those lines of code: download `scf.py` from this repository and look up "SHERIF". I have added comments at the lines of code that need commenting in your `scf.py`.
